## Project Description :

The project is about to create a Reactjs web Application without the "Create-react-app" tool with webpack 5 configuration and server side rendering for API calls also the use of localStorage for some data saving saving.

### The main stacks and Features used in this project :

- Hooks : useState , useEffect , useContext , UseReducer .
- Express
- React-Router-Dom
- isomorphic-fetch
- axios
- Implementation of Babel config
- webpack config for Client and Server bundles , entry / output points .
- Implementation of webpack confing for Production mode , dist folder including : js , css , bundling ...
- Jest ( test configuration added with just one initial test to check if the configuration if is working or not)
- dotenv for environment variables .
- serialize-javascript
- SASS / SCSS ( node compilation, without extension)
- Material Ui
- react-alice-carousel
- LocalStorage

### Mistakes auto evaluation and Features that should be added in the future :

1. Of Course bugs fixes ( for carousel component in this project and for page refresh )
2. adding Pagination for each Api call , Custom pagination component is added but it fetch the new pages in Client side so i deleted that Feature to make the pagination fetch only works in server side .
3. Adding Real tests with jest ( unit tests and integraion tests) .
4. SCSS files refactor and adding mixins mostly to organize the styles .
5. Fix axios Api call for Youtube Videos for each meadia item yes i saw the bug but i was busy haha .
6. customHook for axios .
7. SCSS responsive version for all routes content.

- The .env file and dist are uploaded in purpose not by mistake , the main reason is for any one who wants to learn then they can use the api key to check the api calls at first then get ur key.
